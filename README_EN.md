# About

- This project originated from a browser extension I used, [BookmarkHub](https://github.com/dudor/BookmarkHub). The original project hadn't been maintained for a long time, so it was refactored, incorporating some personal ideas.

- BookMark Bookmark Manager is a browser extension developed by [WXT+VUE](https://wxt.dev/), using WXT+React from the original [BookmarkHub](https://github.com/dudor/BookmarkHub).

- Supported browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and any Chromium-based browser extension.

- It uses GitHub's Gist records to store browser bookmarks.
